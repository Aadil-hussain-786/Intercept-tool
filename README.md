## Overview

### What is Interception?

Interception refers to the capture and analysis of data packets traveling across a network. It is a crucial technique in cybersecurity used to identify vulnerabilities and unauthorized data access.

### Role in Penetration Testing

In penetration testing, interception helps ethical hackers understand data transmission and potential security breaches, enabling them to fortify security measures.

### Project Overview

This project consists of:

- **Frontend:** Built with HTML and CSS, offering a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Backend:** Powered by Node.js and Express, handling data interception and analysis.

## Development Process

### Backend: Node.js and Express

- **Node.js:** Provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture for handling multiple network requests simultaneously.
- **Express:** Simplifies development with robust routing and middleware capabilities, handling HTTP requests and serving as a bridge between the frontend and backend.

### Frontend: HTML and CSS

- **Intuitive Dashboard:** Displays real-time data capture results.
- **User-Friendly Controls:** Simplifies starting, stopping, and configuring the interception process.

## Insights for Developers

- **Understand the Basics:** Grasp fundamental concepts of interception and network traffic analysis.
- **Leverage Node.js and Express:** Ideal for building scalable and efficient backend services.
- **Focus on User Experience:** Ensure a well-designed frontend for accessibility and effectiveness.
- **Continuous Testing:** Regularly test in different network environments for reliability and performance.
